## Decision Making

Decision flow:

1. Technical proposals discussed publicly

Security and stability always take priority.

## Commercial Features

To ensure long-term sustainability:

- The core library remains open-source
- Advanced and enterprise features may be commercial
- Commercial roadmap decisions remain under company ownership

This allows ASH to stay free while funding continued development.
